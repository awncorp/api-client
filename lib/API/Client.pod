=head1 ABSTRACT

HTTP API Thin-Client Abstraction

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package main;

  use API::Client;

  my $client = API::Client->new(url => 'https://httpbin.org');

  # $client->resource('post');

  # $client->update(json => {...});

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides an abstraction and method for rapidly developing HTTP API
clients. While this module can be used to interact with APIs directly,
API::Client was designed to be consumed (subclassed) by higher-level
purpose-specific API clients.

=head1 THIN CLIENT

The thin API client library is advantageous as it has complete API coverage and
can easily adapt to changes in the API with minimal effort. As a thin-client
superclass, this module does not map specific HTTP requests to specific
routines, nor does it provide parameter validation, pagination, or other
conventions found in typical API client implementations; Instead, it simply
provides a simple and consistent mechanism for dynamically generating HTTP
requests.  Additionally, this module has support for debugging and retrying API
calls as well as throwing exceptions when 4xx and 5xx server response codes are
returned.

=head1 SCENARIOS

This package supports the following scenarios:

=cut

=head2 building

  # given: synopsis

  my $resource = $client->resource('get');

  # GET /get
  my $get = $client->resource('get')->dispatch;

  # HEAD /head
  my $head = $client->resource('head')->dispatch(
    method => 'head'
  );

  # PATCH /patch
  my $patch = $client->resource('patch')->dispatch(
    method => 'patch'
  );

  [$get, $head, $patch]

Building up an HTTP request is extremely easy, simply call the L</resource> to
create a new object instance representing the API endpoint you wish to issue a
request against.

=cut

=head2 chaining

  # given: synopsis

  # https://httpbin.org/users
  my $users = $client->resource('users');

  # https://httpbin.org/users/c09e91a
  my $user = $client->resource('users', 'c09e91a');

  # https://httpbin.org/users/c09e91a
  my $new_user = $users->resource('c09e91a');

  [$users, $user, $new_user]

Because each call to L</resource> returns a new object instance configured with
a path (resource locator) based on the supplied parameters, reuse and request
isolation are made simple, i.e., you will only need to configure the client
once in your application.

=cut

=head2 creating

  # given: synopsis

  my $tx1 = $client->resource('post')->create(
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  # is equivalent to

  my $tx2 = $client->resource('post')->dispatch(
    method => 'post',
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  [$tx1, $tx2]

This example illustrates how you might create a new API resource.

=cut

=head2 deleting

  # given: synopsis

  my $tx1 = $client->resource('delete')->delete(
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  # is equivalent to

  my $tx2 = $client->resource('delete')->dispatch(
    method => 'delete',
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  [$tx1, $tx2]

This example illustrates how you might delete a new API resource.

=cut

=head2 fetching

  # given: synopsis

  my $tx1 = $client->resource('get')->fetch(
    query => {active => 1}
  );

  # is equivalent to

  my $tx2 = $client->resource('get')->dispatch(
    method => 'get',
    query => {active => 1}
  );

  [$tx1, $tx2]

This example illustrates how you might fetch an API resource.

=cut

=head2 subclassing

  package Hookbin;

  use Data::Object::Class;

  extends 'API::Client';

  sub auth {
    ['admin', 'secret']
  }

  sub headers {
    [['Accept', '*/*']]
  }

  sub base {
    ['https://httpbin.org/get']
  }

  package main;

  my $hookbin = Hookbin->new;

This package was designed to be subclassed and provides hooks into the client
building and request dispatching processes. Specifically, there are three
useful hooks (i.e. methods, which if present are used to build up the client
object and requests), which are, the C<auth> hook, which should return a
C<Tuple[Str, Str]> which is used to configure the basic auth header, the
C<base> hook which should return a C<Tuple[Str]> which is used to configure the
base URL, and the C<headers> hook, which should return a
C<ArrayRef[Tuple[Str, Str]]> which are used to configure the HTTP request
headers.

=cut

=head2 transacting

  # given: synopsis

  my $tx1 = $client->resource('patch')->patch(
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  # is equivalent to

  my $tx2 = $client->resource('patch')->dispatch(
    method => 'patch',
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  [$tx1, $tx2]

An HTTP request is only issued when the L</dispatch> method is called, directly
or indirectly. Those calls return a L<Mojo::Transaction> object which provides
access to the C<request> and C<response> objects.

=cut

=head2 updating

  # given: synopsis

  my $tx1 = $client->resource('put')->update(
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  # is equivalent to

  my $tx2 = $client->resource('put')->dispatch(
    method => 'put',
    json => {active => 1}
  );

  [$tx1, $tx2]

This example illustrates how you might update a new API resource.
